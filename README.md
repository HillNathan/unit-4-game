This repository was created to hold a homework assignment for the Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a basic RPG game with a theme selected by the creator. I chose to use animals. Each animal has base stats of Attack Power, Counter-attack power, and Hit Points. Their attack is increased by their base attack power each time they attack, while counter-attack does not increase. 

The game should be able to be won no matter what animal is chosen, the strategy is in choosing the proper order of combat to maximize initial combat with animals that have lower counter-attack power to build up their own attack power. I have included in the repo a spreadsheet showing the data on how I balanced the game mechanics.
